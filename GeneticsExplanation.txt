compound layer = monecules

partslayer is multipurpose, depends on linking layer


linking layer is pairs of 0-256 numbers

first in pair defines part
second defines what that part connects to


both in pair refer to a location in the parts layer
idx = 7*number

0->7*256

the 1st points to seven 0-256 numbers
0: comp. to jump to in compound layer, this is the structure of the part
1: % length of comp is the size of the critical region
2: % number of extant part types (hardcoded, depends on what i get done) is what part it is, possibly weighted
3: metadata of part
4: more metadata?
6 and 7 tbd. maybe dont need this many

the 2nd points to some number of numbers
0: % 8 or something, defines whether this part will connect to some # more new parts, reach backwards and connect to some # of parts already built, or just end
1-2: either direction of reach and length of reach, or the product of #1%7 and #2%7 is the number of hops forward that we take to find the next connecting link section
repeat as per the number of connections specified by #0
